A few groups have asked if there is a timer situation to shutdown the RPi after a set amount of time.
These scripts set up a timer that is started on when the Pi is powered.  From the repo the timer will run for 3h~ (non-realtime)

current non-tested (2/24/2017)

To run these files you need to allow for them to be executables.
To do this use 

chmod +x setup.sh

chmod +x timer.sh
